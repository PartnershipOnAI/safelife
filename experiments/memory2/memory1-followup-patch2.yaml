# Use this file to run a parameter sweep on wandb.
#
# First, initialize the sweep by running
#
#     wandb sweep training/example-sweep.yaml
#
# This will print out a sweep id. Then just run
#
#     wandb agent <sweep-id>
#
# or
#
#     gcloud/start-remote-job <remote> <sweep-id> --sweep
#
# and that should be it! You can start as many concurrent agents as you want.
# More details can be found at https://docs.wandb.com/sweeps/quickstart.
